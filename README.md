# Reinfrocement-Learning-Agent-Playing-2048
In this project I built the game '2048' and build a model using vanilla Deep Reinforcement Learning(DRL) to try to let the agent successfully dominant the game.

Though the game itself was a success, there's still some minor problem for the program.
- Deciding whether use Linear or CNN input to the agent,
- Games since to be stuck at the end, where there's only one orientation to choose but the agent choose another one, and the propgram just stucks,
- need edit for reward function
- haven't trained the agent
- haven't design to save the model's parameter
